# 7-Day SQL Challenge: Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains SQL scripts for a 7-Day SQL Challenge designed to enhance SQL proficiency using the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist. The challenge progresses from foundational to advanced SQL techniques, including schema creation, joins, aggregations, window functions, CTEs, and date/time analysis, applied to real-world e-commerce data.

The dataset includes ~100,000 anonymized orders from 2016â€“2018 across Brazilian marketplaces, covering orders, customers, products, payments, reviews, sellers, and geolocation.

- **Tasks**: Identify orders without reviews, track monthly sales, find sellers with diverse categories

### Day 3: Advanced

- **Focus**: Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `LAG`) and CTEs  
- **Tasks**: Rank customers by spend, calculate revenue growth, find top sellers per category

### Day 4: Synthesis

- **Focus**: Combine joins, subqueries, CTEs, and window functions  
- **Tasks**: Analyze payment types over time, calculate cancellation rates, review on-time deliveries

### Day 5: Business Questions

- **Focus**: High-level business problems  
- **Tasks**: Monthly sales by state, customer acquisition cohorts, seller performance by reviews

### Day 6: Date and Time Analysis
